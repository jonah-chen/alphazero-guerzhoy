IN PROGRESS

Mastering gomoku using the General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm from DeepMind in the paper published here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24270. Entry to the ESC180 gomoku class contest for Gomoku after project 2 (basic computer player based on rule based system).

Note: gomoku.py is redacted and will be released at a later time. However, no other file depends on that file.

Completed:  
Game  
Optimize game  
Write neural network  
Write Monte-Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) Algorithm  
Debug (This took way too long lmao)  

TODO:  
Train network (In Progress ~10000 games: I think the agent just learned what a draw is)
MORE BUGS :(  
Win!
